#Quarantine Blues
When the whole world is transmitting a deadly virus with no known cure, you need to stay **home**. But staying home is _boring_! We've come up with some things you can do to keep the blues, and Covid-19, away.

* wash your hands
* read a book
* wash your hands
* watch a program
* wash your hands again
* read a book about pandemics
* cook some food

When that all stops being fun, you could go to the window and look out. For a novel sensory experience, you can open the window a crack, and _smell_ out. That's right, keep your eyes closed and press your nose against the screen! The possibilities here are nearly endless; you could also _listen_ out or _feel_ out. 

Today, Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot gave a press conference in which she announced all Chicago public schools would be closed until April 20 at the earliest. She also announced the formation of a $100-million fund to help local small businesses. One quarter of the money is coming from the city; the rest is coming from private donors (here's looking at you, Goldman Sachs) and I can't remember all the rest. She urged others to follow suit:
>"We know that there’s a significant amount of economic pressure all over, but particularly service employees, hourly workers in the hospitality area in particular. That’s why we’re looking at ways to give them relief to put money in their pocket rather than collecting it in fines and fees, or worse, driving people into bankruptcy."

[Here](https://www.facebook.com/abc7chicago/videos/2663544127077625/) she is in her suit.

That's not really a suit, but it is a power outfit.

Hopefully people will take this seriously and stay indoors.
